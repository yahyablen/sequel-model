! WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) is an API typically used for peer-to-peer calling/video chat.

! Unfortunately, it has both privacy (leaks in certain cases, depending on browser/implementation/etc.) and security concerns...

! Some browsers like Firefox (via `media.peerconnection.enabled`) support disabling WebRTC, but it's unfortunately all or nothing and breaks websites, and other browsers (like Chromium) don't support disabling WebRTC at all. :/

! Blocking it this way with uBlock Origin allows users to control WebRTC *per-site*, and grants the ability to block WebRTC on browsers that don't support disabling it.
