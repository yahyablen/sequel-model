! Description: Block SVG to harden the security of your web browser.
! Homepage: https://badblock.celenity.dev

! SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) typically used for advanced graphics on webpages
! https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG
! Unfortunately, it has security concerns...

! For reference, Tor Browser disables this in its 'Safest' mode
! Some browsers like Firefox (via `svg.disabled`) support disabling SVG, but it's unfortunately all or nothing and breaks websites, and other browsers (like Chromium) don't support disabling SVG at all :/
! Blocking it this way via uBlock Origin allows users to control SVG *per-site*, and grants the ability to block SVG on browsers that don't support disabling it
