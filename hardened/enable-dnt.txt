! Homepage: https://badblock.celenity.dev

! This list (partially) enables DNT (Do Not Track) to signal to websites that you object to tracking.
! Legally binding in some regions (such as Germany).

! I specify "partially" here because due to limitations with uBlock Origin, this list *only* enables DNT in the Navigator; we're unable to add the `DNT` HTTP header...

!! Nearly all browsers have built-in support for DNT, and DNT itself is being deprecated/removed from browsers in favor of GPC, so this list doesn't have much use; but I figured it may be handy for certain circumstances.
