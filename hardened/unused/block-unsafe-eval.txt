! eval() is a JavaScript function used for code execution

! It poses major security concerns...

! https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_direct_eval!
! This also includes the execution of WASM (WebAssembly)
! https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#unsafe_webassembly_execution
! WASM also poses security concerns...

! For reference, Tor Browser disables WASM in its 'Safer' mode
! Some browsers like Firefox (via `javascript.options.wasm`) support disabling WASM, but it's unfortunately all or nothing and breaks websites, and other browsers (like Chromium) don't support disabling WASM at all :/
! Blocking it this way via uBlock Origin allows users to control WASM (as well as other `unsafe-eval`) *per-site*, and grants the ability to block WASM (and `unsafe-eval`) on browsers that don't support disabling it
