! Beacon (navigator.sendBeacon ()) is an API used for analytics/tracking by design.

! Blocking it also provides additional attack surface reduction.

! Some browsers like Firefox (via `beacon.enabled`) support disabling the Beacon API, but it's unfortunately all or nothing and breaks websites, and other browsers (like Chromium) don't support disabling the Beacon API at all. :/

! Blocking it this way with uBlock Origin allows users to control the Beacon API *per-site*, and grants the ability to block the Beacon API on browsers that don't support disabling it.

!! This list should generally NOT be used by Firefox users. Firefox users should instead set `beacon.enabled` to `false` via their `about:config` *(or some other means...)* and use the `Beacon API Stub` list: https://codeberg.org/celenity/Phoenix/raw/branch/pages/uBlock/beacon.txt - as this approach is more effective for multiple reasons *(See the list itself for details...)*.
!! This list should also NOT be used by Cromite users, as Cromite already stubs the Beacon API.
