# Title: ðŸ“¡ BadBlock - Radar (Wildcards *)
# Version: 20June2024v1
# Expires: 12 hours
# Description: Block advertising, analytics, unwanted data collection, tracking, & more as they arise!
# Homepage: https://codeberg.org/Magnesium1062/BadBlock

# Goal is to block general analytics/tracking/advertising/telemetry/metrics/promotions/crash reporting/etc. domains that I discover, not including those found on other BadBlock lists, but this list will be included in BadBlock Lite, BadBlock, & BadBlock+.

# Goal will be NOT to break any email/referral links where reasonable, please report any breakage or issues.

# Please do not use this as your exclusive list block list, as always with BadBlock lists, you should use other high quality lists as well, such as the great HaGeZi's.
