# Title: üç™ Annoyances (Wildcards no *)
# Version: 04July2024v1
# Expires: 12 hours
# Description: Block Cookie banners, Live Chat widgets, & more!
# Homepage: https://codeberg.org/Magnesium1062/BadBlock

# Goal here is blocking annoyances on a DNS level.

# This will probably cause breakage, so I'll only include it on BadBlock+, but of course you will always have the option to use it individually in combination with any other list.

# Please report any issues. :)

# CMPs
# I was originally conflicted on blocking these, but due to the reasons Brave lists here: https://brave.com/privacy-updates/21-blocking-cookie-notices/, I've decided to go for it. CMPs are not only obnoxious, they are also designed in a way to deceive users, can't be trusted to even do their job, & act as trackers themselves. I don't negotiate with terrorists. Interesting paper: https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf
